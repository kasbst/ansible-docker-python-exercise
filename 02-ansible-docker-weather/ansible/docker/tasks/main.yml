# As an initial step we make sure that we have our

# two:
# - apt-transport-https makes us be able to use

# Because apt makes use of public key crypto to fetch
# packages we must tell it what's the public key of the
# source that is signing the packages we want to retrieve,
# that is, we need to add the repository's key.

# Add the official docker apt repository so that `apt`
# can list packages from it and then fetch them from

# With `update_cache` we force an `apt update` which

# The docker daemon binds to a Unix socket instead of a TCP port. 
# By default that Unix socket is owned by the user root and other 
# users can only access it using sudo. The docker daemon always 
# runs as the root user. If you donâ€™t want to use sudo when you use 
# the docker command, create a Unix group called docker and add 
# users to it. When the docker daemon starts, it makes the ownership 
# of the Unix socket read/writable by the docker group.

# Without adding the unprivileged 
# user to the docker group we can't

# by systemd. Here we take a list of users that
# we want to make part of the `docker` group and
# do it.

# Once Docker has finished the installation (which involves
# setting a systemd service) we have the option to either
# enable that service or not. By enabling it, systemd hooks
# the docker unit into specific places such that whenever the
# machine boots we have this service started.
